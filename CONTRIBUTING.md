## How can I contribute?

### I'm having difficulty installing, operating or building this project

Head over to our [Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/toae-community/shared_invite/zt-podmzle9-5X~qYx8wMaLt9bGWwkSdgQ) and share what's going on.  It's generally useful to include details of your installation, `docker images list` and `docker ps -a`, or the equivalent Kubernetes commands are a good start.  Logs from any containers that may be misbehaving are also useful.

### I think I have found a bug 

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please refer to our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).

For all other bugs, please [first check if the issue has already been opened](/issues).  If so, go ahead and add details to the existing issue.

If the bug appears to be new, please [open a new GitHub Bug report](/issues/new/choose).  The template will prompt you for the information that will help us to understand and address the issue.

### I'd like to share a change 

Thank you.  Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with a clear explanation of what you're seeking to achieve, and what you have done.

Code Style: we're flexible and accomodating. Copy the style of the code adjacent to your contributions, keep it clear and easy to understand for other developers and we're all good.

### I have an idea for an enhancement

If it's a well-formed enhancement, please [open a new GitHub Feature request](/issues/new/choose).  Explain the enhancement and any supporting information - who it benefits, why it's important etc.

If you'd like to discuss the idea before proposing it on GitHub, share it on our [Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/toae-community/shared_invite/zt-podmzle9-5X~qYx8wMaLt9bGWwkSdgQ) and we will work through it together.
